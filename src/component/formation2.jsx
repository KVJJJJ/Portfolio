      <p>I graduated with a BTS in SNIR, which provided me with
         a strong foundation in mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          I also received training in MySQL database administration. 
          Additionally, I am further enhancing my skills through self-learning,
          particularly with React.js for web development.
